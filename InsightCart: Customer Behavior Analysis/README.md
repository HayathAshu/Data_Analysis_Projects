# 📊 InsightCart: Customer Behavior Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
InsightCart is a comprehensive **Customer Behavior Analysis** project focused on understanding customer shopping patterns, preferences, and purchasing trends.  
The objective of this project is to convert raw customer data into actionable insights that support business decision-making.

This project showcases an **end-to-end data analysis workflow** using Python, SQL, Power BI, and modern presentation tools.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Businesses generate large volumes of customer shopping data, but raw data alone does not provide value.  
The challenge is to analyze customer behavior to answer critical business questions such as:

- How do customers shop and spend?
- Which product categories perform the best?
- How does purchasing behavior vary across different customer segments?
- What insights can help improve marketing, sales, and customer retention strategies?

The goal of this project is to analyze customer shopping data and extract meaningful insights through data analysis and visualization.

## 🧠 My Thinking & Approach
I approached this project as a **real-world business problem**, not just a technical exercise.

- Focused on *why* the analysis matters, not just *how* it is performed
- Used Python for deep and flexible analysis
- Used SQL to strengthen business data querying skills
- Used Power BI for impactful data storytelling
- Used Gamma to present insights professionally and effectively

The goal was to simulate how data analysis is performed in an industry environment—from raw data to decision-ready insights.
